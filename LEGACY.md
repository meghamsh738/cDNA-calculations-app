# cDNA Calculations App — Legacy Notes

This file is reserved for any legacy/archived implementation notes. The actively maintained modern app lives in `modern-app/` and is documented in the root `README.md`.

If you still need the legacy (pre-modern) workflow, document it here. Otherwise, prefer the modern app.
